"""
LLM prompting layer for the analysis pipeline.

All generation goes through one chat-based core with:
- JSON-schema-enforced output (Ollama `format` schema / OpenAI json_schema)
- temperature 0 and a fixed seed for reproducibility
- keep_alive so Ollama keeps the model loaded across sequential calls
- semantic validation with one corrective retry

Capabilities (all optional — the pipeline works without any of them):
- label_group:        topic name + one-sentence summary per question group
- verify_same_topic:  yes/no check for borderline group merges
- summarize_analysis: executive summary of the whole analysis
- detect_questions:   find help requests the regex extractor missed
- is_answered:        decide whether thread replies resolved a question

Correct answer: {"questions": [

{"index": 0, "question": "Is there a way to bulk-disable actions?", "type": "is-it-possible"},

DO NOT answer message 2 like this: {"index": 2, "question": "They want to see the action log and group actions, any thoughts?"}
Wrong because: 'Any thoughts?' is RHETORICAL and must be dropped; the two REAL questions must be split into two entries; 'they' must be made explicit using the CONTEXT sentence.

DO NOT answer message 3 with three entries ("Find file001.txt in folder", "Find file002.txt in folder", "Invoke Flow Service to merge the files").
Wrong because: those are steps of ONE workflow — the only ask is whether the workflow can be configured.

DO NOT answer message 4 like this: {"index": 4, "question": "How do I bypass antivirus scanning errors?"}
Wrong because: the asker never said bypass — they reported a failure and want it explained or fixed. Describe the symptom; never name a resolution they didn't state.
